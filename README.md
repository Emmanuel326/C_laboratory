# ðŸ§  C-lab

A personal lab documenting my journey into *C programming, **Assembly, and **low-level systems engineering*.  
This repository is a blend of theory, experiments, and hands-on implementations aimed at mastering performance, memory, and systems-level concepts.

---

## ` Objectives

- Strengthen my understanding of *C language fundamentals*
- Explore *pointers, memory management, and optimization*
- Dive into *Assembly* for a closer look at how hardware executes code
- Experiment with *low-latency, high-throughput* systems
- Gradually move toward *networking, concurrency, and OS-level programming*
